//! The shift reduction's operand evaluation claims, one per operation.
//!
//! The reduction closes four constraint families in one proof: ZERO, AND, IMUL and BMUL.
//!
//! Each family arrives with its own operand evaluation claim.
//! Those four claims then travel together through both phases of the reduction.
//!
//! Passed as four positional arguments, they are easy to hand over in the wrong order.
//! Bundling them names each claim where it is built.
//!
//! Each claim also carries its operation's arity in its type, so no two share one.
//! Putting a BMUL claim in the IMUL field is a type error, not a wrong proof.
//!
//! The batched form erases that arity, because a shift key picks its operation at run time.
//! There the operation is named by indexing instead: `prepared[key.operation]`.
