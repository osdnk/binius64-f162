/// Such a gate's result is already carried by another wire, so its readers are pointed at that
/// wire instead. The gate is then unread, and the dead-code pass drops it along with the
/// constraint it would have emitted.
///
/// Zeros arise from padding rather than from anything a circuit author writes by hand. A message
/// block zero-filled to its block size is the common case, and a hash that mixes every word of
/// its block pays a carry chain per zero word per round without this.
///
/// Returns the number of wire slots rewritten.
///
/// # Algorithm
///
/// Zeros travel: clearing a zero leaves zero, and packing zero into a lane leaves zero. So one
/// sweep is not enough, and the sweeps repeat until one changes nothing.
///
/// Each sweep rebuilds the reader index first. Forwarding to an ordinary wire grows that wire's
/// set of readers, which a stale index would not list, and a later sweep forwarding that same
/// wire would then miss those readers.
///
/// Only the reader half is rebuilt. This pass follows readers, never definitions.
