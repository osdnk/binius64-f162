//! logUp* verification with the pushforwards committed as oracles.
//!
//! The bare reduction returns a claimed evaluation of each table's pushforward `Y = I_* eq_r`.
//! It never binds them to commitments, so those claims cannot be checked on their own.
//! This layer receives one `Y` oracle per table over the IOP channel and returns the relations that
//! open them.
//!
//! The receives precede the reduction, so its logUp challenges bind the received oracles.
//! The tables `T` and indexes `I` stay the caller's oracles, so their claims are returned
//! unchanged. The pushforwards are the only oracles this protocol introduces, per
//! [Soukhanov25, Section 3].
